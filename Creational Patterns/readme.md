# Creational Design Patterns
Creative design patterns play a key role in software engineering by abstracting the instantiation process. These patterns provide different ways of creating objects, ensuring that the system is independent of how its objects are created, composed and represented. In this article, we will look at five key instantiation design patterns in C#, exploring their implementations and practical applications: Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, and Prototype.
Creational Patterns:
- Singleton Pattern
- Factory Method Pattern
- Abstract Factory Pattern
- Builder Pattern
- Prototype Pattern
- Object Pool Pattern
